Only 1 <h1> for per webpage. It acts as the title of the page.

Use <h> tags for hierarchy/structure of a webpage
same types of content should have the same <h>

lower <h> gets nested inside of higher <h>

CSS

text align start center end

images are inline element
if I just want the image in the center I can just use text align center to the parent of the image


Mesurements

px are the most used css mesurment 
but for font-size use rem, (best practice)
dont overwrite user preference
dont change the font size of the <html> tag

rem = font-size of the parent IE 16px
so use multiples of rem to have a consistent size
so if the user changes the defult font size the rest of the elements change consistently

line-height: 1.6; sets the line hight to 1.6x of the font size

margin -> wight space around an element box model
margin-block: 50px; adding 50px on block element, top and bottom?

everything in CSS is a box

inline-size = width
inline-size -> the size of the box in the line that it is taking up
block-size = hight

block -> top(start) and bottom(end)
inline -> left(start) and right(end)

use inline-size and block-size instead of width and height
it makes more logical naming

if u need more backgroud use padding

padding -> backgroud
border -> can use diffrent color from background

padding -> empty space that includes the backgroud color, around the border
margine -> empty space but no backgroud colour, around the content box

content box -> padding -> border -> margin 
holds content -> for more backgorud colour -> for adding border -> empty space with no colour used for seperating elemnts?
